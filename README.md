<h1 align="center"><strong>Starter project for Fullstack React Apollo GraphQL with Prisma</strong></h1>

This starter project is extended from [React Full Stack Graphql](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/react-fullstack-graphql)

<br />

## Features

- **GraphQL database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to [Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com) (running on MySQL)
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)

## Requirements

You need to have the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) installed to bootstrap your GraphQL server using `graphql create`.
You need to have docker installed to deploy the database and the prisma service to docker instances.

```sh
npm i -g graphql-cli
npm i -g docker
```

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Deploy the docker instances
cd <project folder>
yarn setup

# 2. Navigate into the `server` directory of the new project
cd <project folder>/server

# 3. Start the server
yarn dev # runs server on http://localhost:4000, and opens GraphQL PLayground on http://localhost:5000

# 4. Open a new tab in the terminal and navigate back into my-app;
# then run the app
cd ..
yarn start
```
